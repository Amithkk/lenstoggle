This is just a simple lens Toggler.  

--Issues--
It requires logout and login for changes to take effect.
unity --replace & and setsid unity both mangled my screenlets placement.
If you want it to do that, it's a simple modification to the .py file.

There is no softlink in /usr/bin yet.  I'll get around to that if
I can figure out how to get it to play nicely with launchpad.

--Recommendations--
Revert all your lenses to ON before any updates just to be safe.

--Documentation--
It's pretty simple and pretty well commented.

--How to run--
gksu python LensToggle.py

It needs root permissions since it moves some folders in /usr/share/unity
